```
'''This module implements specialized container datatypes providing
alternatives to Python's general purpose built-in containers, dict,
list, set, and tuple.

* namedtuple   factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
* deque        list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
* ChainMap     dict-like class for creating a single view of multiple mappings
* Counter      dict subclass for counting hashable objects
* OrderedDict  dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
* defaultdict  dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
* UserDict     wrapper around dictionary objects for easier dict subclassing
* UserList     wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
* UserString   wrapper around string objects for easier string subclassing
